**artoo** is a client-side scraping companion.

This means concretely that **artoo** is merely a JavaScript piece of code that can be injected within any web page to provide you with some useful utilities if you intent to scrape the said page.

**artoo** might therefore be invoked by a JavaScript bookmarklet. Click it and **artoo** will come to the rescue. You'll then be able to use him within your browser's console.

But **artoo** is not only a console tool. He is also a kind of framework useful to anyone requiring to perform complex client-side scraping tasks. He is indeed as fit for quick & dirty scraping jobs as for more ambitious data burglaries.
