# artoo

## Full documentation
**artoo**'s full documentation is available [here](https://medialab.github.io/artoo).

## Concept
**artoo** is a piece of JavaScript code meant to be run in your browser's console to provide you with some scraping utilites.

**artoo** is loaded into the JavaScript context of any webpage through a handy bookmarklet you can instantly install by dropping the icon below onto your bookmark bar.

<p align="center">
  <a href='javascript: (function(){var t={},o=!0;if("object"==typeof this.artoo)artoo.reload||(artoo.log.verbose("artoo already lies within this page. No need to inject him again."),artoo.loadSettings(t),artoo.hooks.trigger("exec"),o=!1);else if(o){var e=document.getElementsByTagName("body")[0],a=document.createElement("script");console.log("artoo is loading..."),a.src="https://rawgit.com/medialab/artoo/master/build/artoo.min.js",a.type="text/javascript",a.id="artoo_injected_script",a.setAttribute("settings",JSON.stringify(t)),e.appendChild(a)}}).call(this);' id='bookmarklet'>
    <img alt="artoo" width="148" height="148" src="https://medialab.github.io/artoo/public/img/artoo-icon.svg" />
  </a>
</p>

Just click the freshly created bookmark and **artoo** should greet you within your browser's console and tell you he is ready to roll.

But **artoo** is not only a console tool. He can also be used as a framework useful to anyone requiring to perform complex client-side scraping tasks.

He is therefore as fit for your quick & dirty scraping jobs as for more ambitious data heists.
