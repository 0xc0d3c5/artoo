**artoo** ships with a variety of settings for you to adjust.

You can change **artoo**'s settings either by changing them directly through JavaScript

```js
artoo.settings.debug = true;

// Or if you need to merge settings:
artoo.loadSettings({
  debug: false
});
```

Or by specifying a precise configuration in a custom bookmarklet generated by **artoo**'s [grunt task]({{ site.baseurl }}/grunt).
