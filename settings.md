**artoo.js** ships with a variety of settings for you to adjust.

You can change the library's settings either by changing them directly through JavaScript:

```js
artoo.settings.debug = true;

// Or if you need to merge settings:
artoo.loadSettings({
  debug: false
});
```

Or by specifying a precise configuration in a custom bookmarklet generated by **artoo.js**' [grunt task]({{ site.baseurl }}/grunt).

* **autoExec** *boolean* [`true`] : should the given script be evaluated when artoo is started?
* **autoInit** *boolean* [`true`] : should **artoo** launch his initialization routine when loaded? If the routine is not automatically launched, you'll have to do it yourself with `artoo.init()`.

<h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2>

**artoo** enables you to load some popular dependencies alongside jQuery when he is injected within a webpage.

To do so, just add an array of desired dependencies in the settings like in the example below:

```json
{
  "dependencies": ["async", "lodash"]
}
```

Or, if you want to load a library from a url of your choice and not from artoo default cdn (*jsDelivr* & *cdnjs*):

```json
{
  "dependencies": [
    {
      "name": "async",
      "url": "my/custom/async.min.js"
    }
  ]
}
```

*Supported libraries*

* [async](https://github.com/caolan/async)
* [underscore](http://underscorejs.org/)
* [lodash](http://lodash.com/)
